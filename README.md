# ATM

Simple main.ATM experiment in Java

## How to use this application

I developed this application using IntelliJ IDEA. To run the app, simply click on the green arrow icon next to the main method on the main class:

```
src/main/Main.java
```

## Notes

There are plenty of ways to improve this application, which I would be happy to discuss further. This approach is the fastest I could deliver given the time constrains I had.
